# What is DSSGx
DSSG helps not-for-profit organisations and government bodies to achieve more with their data by enhancing their services, interventions and outreach, helping fulfil their mission of improving the world and people's lives.

In 2021, Warwick is organising DSSGx UK Summer Projects - a 12-week Fellowship programme that trains students to create industry-standard data science products in collaboration with government agencies and NGOs, to deliver positive social impact.

The programme gives not-for-profit organisations and government bodies unprecedented access to inspiring, top-tier data science talent. This helps build their capacity to use cutting-edge quantitative methods to address societal challenges in areas such as education, health, energy, public safety, transportation and economic development.

DSSGx Summer Projects are delivered by the University of Warwick in collaboration with Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t in Munich under the DSSGx UK chapter of the DSSG Foundation, and supported by the Alan Turing Institute.
